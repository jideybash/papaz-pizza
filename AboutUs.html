                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
                <p>There’s nothing cookie-cutter about My Pizza. Not our pizzas. Not our people. 
                    And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t settle for anything less than food 
                    we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, 
                    and have fun while we’re at it.</p>
                <h1>WHAT WE'RE ABOUT</h1>
                <p>At Papaz Pizza, we don’t just make pizza. We make people happy. 
                    Papaz Pizza was built on the belief that pizza night should be special, and we carry that belief into 
                    everything we do. With more than 60 years of experience under our belts, we understand how to 
                    best serve our customers through tried and true service principles: We create food we’re proud 
                    to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile.</p>
                <h1>WHERE WE COME FROM</h1>
                <p>In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas.
                    They named it Papaz Pizza, because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound!
                    Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home.
                    And the customers were treated like family. And we’ve been delivering that same food and service ever since.</p>
                    <p>Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority.
                        No one loves pizza more than Papaz Pizza. That’s why pizza is in our name — and always will be.
                    </p>
                    <p>And we’ve been delivering that same food and service ever since.</p>
