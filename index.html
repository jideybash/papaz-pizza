                <h1> FOR THE LOVE OF PIZZA</h1>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h1>THE CHOICE IS YOURS</h1>
                <p>Take a peek at how we've always been leaders in the pizza industry,
                    from pizza creations like the first-ever Supreme Pizza to mainstreaming the use
                    of shredded cheese on a pizza. Delicious developments all around.
                </p>
                <p>For many, "Papaz Pizza" is best known for one particular pizza - and the Pan Pizza.
                    This signature item from "Papaz Pizza" is loved all around the world, and features a dough recipe all its own.
                    Our Pan Pizza rises in proofers every singlw day, just like breads at an artisan bakery.
                    Its costs more, but we think it's worth it.
                </p>
            
                    <p>The beauty of pizza - and virtually everything else on our menu - 
                        is that it is a made-to-order product, made just as you request it. In fact,
                        there are 34 million different combinations available in ordering just one "Papaz Pizza".
                        You can choose to order an indulgent Handmade Pan Pizza, extra cheese MeatZZa Specialty PizzaÂ® 
                        or you can order a thin crust pizza with a smaller portion of cheese and topped with quality 
                        ingredients such as fresh baby spinach and grilled chicken breast. Either way, we'll provide a 
                        high quality, oven baked meal, made to your specifications. Because there are millions of ways to 
                        make a Papaz Pizza.
